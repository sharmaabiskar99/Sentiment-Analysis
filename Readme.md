Sentiment Analysis Project
Description

This is my Sentiment Analysis project where I intend to segment the customer reviews as Positive or Negative. Through employing the approaches of machine learning, I extract and classify text data, and estimate customers’ sentiment regarding specific goods or services.
Project Structure

    code.ipynb: The primary Jupyter assignment in which all phases, including data preparation, feature extraction, model training, and assessment, take place.
    README.md: This file, containing information about the project, how to install it and how to use it.
    dataset/: A folder which comprises of the data I employed in training the sentiment analysis model.
    models/: A folder in which trained models are kept.

Dataset

The dataset I am using has two features: text from customer reviews and a binary flag denoting positivity/negativity of the review. In this process, I’ve also reviewed and preprocessed the textual data to provide the best input for the modeling algorithms.
Key Features

    Text Preprocessing: In order to clean the data I applied the following steps: removal of stop words, tokenization, and either stemming or lemmatization.
    Feature Extraction: For text features, I applied BoW and TF-IDF techniques.
    Model Training: In my case, I tried with several machine learning models such as:
        Logistic Regression
        Naive Bayes
        Support Vector Machines (SVM)
        Random Forest
    Model Evaluation: As theالشعار performance assessment of the models, I employed different quantitative measures including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score together with the confusion matrix.

Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository:

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash

git clone https:))). This path is written like this //github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
cd sentiment-analysis

2. Install Required Dependencies:

In the requirements.txt I have listed all the necessary Python libraries. Install them using the following command:

bash

For Python packages, the command is wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpamFinder/DataScience-Projects/master/requirements.txt && pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don’t see the requirements.txt file, here are the main dependencies you need:

bash

to install use the following command in terminal or command prompt pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk



3. Running the Notebook:

Once you have the environment set up, run the Jupyter notebook:

bash

jupyter notebook code.ipynb

4. Running the Script:

To analyze your own dataset, simply add it to the dataset/ folder and follow the instructions in the notebook to perform sentiment analysis.
Usage

    Data Preparation: Feel free to replace the current dataset with your own data. Just ensure that your dataset has columns for review text and sentiment labels.
    Model Training: You can train several models and see which one performs best for your data.
    Model Evaluation: I’ve included performance evaluation metrics so you can easily compare different models.

Results

In this project, I demonstrated how different machine learning models can be applied to perform sentiment analysis. The models were evaluated using multiple metrics to find the best performing one, which I saved for future use.
Future Improvements

    I plan to experiment with deep learning models like LSTMs or Transformers to improve sentiment prediction accuracy.
    I’d like to expand the dataset to include reviews from different domains to improve generalization.

3. Running the Notebook:

Once you have the environment set up, run the Jupyter notebook:

bash

jupyter notebook code.ipynb

4. Running the Script:

To run sentiment analysis for the analysis of own self-collected data, just copy it in the dataset/ folder and follow the directions as specified in the notebook.
Usage

    Data Preparation: You can use your own data in the current programs if desired. Its just critical to make sure you have columns in your dataset for the review text and the sentiment labels.
    Model Training: It allows training several models and comparing the one which worked best in terms of a specific data set.
    Model Evaluation: For your convenience, I’ve also added performance evaluation metrics so you could compare the models with each other.

Results

In this project, I showed that it is possible to use different machine learning models for this purpose – to classify texts into positive or negative ones. It was necessary to determine which one of the models performed the best, and the best model was in turn stored for future use.
Future Improvements

    For the next developments, I would like to try LSTM or other types of a deep learning model to enhance sentiment prediction ability.
    I wish I had the reviews of other domains to make a dataset large enough and diversify it to increase the generalization ability.
